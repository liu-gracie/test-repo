    <h2>Michigan</h2> 

    <p>I was born in Monroe, Michigan, in 2004. I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, when I was six and have lived there ever since. Coming to RISD has been my first time moving out of state, but I still like to go home during the summer. When people ask me where I'm from, I will usually answer with Michigan.</p>
